Environement variables
----------------------

This test only gives the ``PATH`` and ``TERM`` environment variables to your minishell by default (see :ref:`config env`).

You can test this quickly with :option:`--try`.

.. warning::
    Please check that your project still work with this environment before creating an issue or messaging me on Slack.
